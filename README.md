# Neural Networks 2nd Assignment

The aim of this project is to train different models based on convolutional neural networks to classify pictures of a given dataset to one of the 10 classes. In this project, we use the MINC-2500 dataset for material recognition.

Here, we have evaluated and utilised, as well as tuned 3 different models: -
1.	AlexNet
2.	Inception-v3
3.	VGG-16

## Testing the Code

1. Extract the test images zip file in the root directory of Google Colab
2. Run the `Inception_v3_testing.ipynb` notebook

### AlexNet

Run the `AlexNet_updated.ipynb` notebook

### VGG-16

Run the `NN_vgg16.ipynb` notebook

### Inception-v3

Run the `Inception_with_pre_processing_MINC_2500.ipynb` notebook
